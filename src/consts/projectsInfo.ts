export const nodeRouterDescription =
	'\nThis project was motivated by the will of understanding how things work. Im mainly using node http module to provide a router to handle HTTP requests and responses. Http node native library has interfaces that handles response and request, but doesnt provide middleware functions by default. Inspired by express and also by the will to understand how a client/server interaction works with node, I created this library and im still improving its functionalities';
